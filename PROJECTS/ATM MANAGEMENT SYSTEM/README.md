                                 ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This report attempts to understand the design of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, a device used by bank customers to process account transactions. Typically, a user inserts into the ATM a special plastic card that is encoded with information on a magnetic strip. The strip contains an identification code that is transmitted to the bank's central computer by modem. To prevent unauthorized transactions, a personal identification number (PIN) must also be entered by the user using a keypad. The computer then permits the ATM to complete the transaction; most machines can dispense cash, accept deposits, transfer funds, and provide information on account balances. Banks have formed cooperative, nationwide networks so that a customer of one bank can use an ATM of another for cash access. Some ATMs will also accept credit cards for cash advances. 



This Project is based on developing an ATM (Automated Teller machine) using “Java Programming Language”. For that we used GUI (Graphical User Interface) in this development so that it will become more users friendly to interact. Automated Teller Machine enables the clients of a bank to have access to their account without going to the bank. This is achieved only by development the application using online concepts. When the product is implemented, the user who uses this product will be able to see all the information and services provided by the ATM, when he enters the necessary option and arguments. The product also provides services like request for cheques, deposit cash and other advanced requirement of the user. The data is stored in the database and is retrieved whenever necessary. The implementation needs ATM machine hardware to operate or similar simulated conditions can also be used to successfully use the developed product

To develop this ATM system the entire operation has been divided into the following step:
1. verification process
2. language, service and account selection
3. Banking services
4. Transactions
5. Special services


The program is designed in such a way that the user has to card and pin number. Once verified, he is provided a menu and he/she had to enter the option provided in the menu. For example, when the user wants to view the list of payment history than he/she had to enter the option for payment history provided in the main menu. When the option is entered alone with the respective argument, then the payment history is displayed on the screen.
The user also must be given option to browse through the pages like previous page, next page, etc. The user may experience a delay in retrieving or viewing the data, when there are many users logged on to the same bank
